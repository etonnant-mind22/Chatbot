# Chatbot

Chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built; Retrieval based and Generative based models.
In this Python project with source code, we are going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. We use a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.

# Let’s create a retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.

This can also customize the data according to business requirements and train the chatbot with great accuracy. Chatbots are used everywhere and all businesses are looking forward to implementing bot in their workflow.
